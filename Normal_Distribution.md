# Normal distribution

Normal distribution is originally called a gaussian curve.
It is denoted as folles: $X\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$
$\mathcal{N}$ is the normal
$\sim$ is the distribution
$\mu$ is the [mean](Mean)
$\sigma$ is the variance

- The Highest point on the curve is the [mean](Mean).
- The spread of the graph is determined by the Standard deviation 
- The mean is = to the median and is  = the mode
- The higher the standard deviation is the sharper the curve is around the mean
  And the lower the Standard deviation is the flatter the curve is. This is also called thinner tails and fatter tails.
