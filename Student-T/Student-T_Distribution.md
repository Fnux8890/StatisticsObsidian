# Student-T distribution
This distribution method is similar to the [normal distribution](Normal_Distribution) But has fatter tails.
This method allows inference through small samples with and unknown population variance.

Formula:  
## $\mathcal{t}_{n-1},\mathcal{a}=\frac{\bar{\mathcal{X}}-\mu}{\mathcal{s}/\sqrt{\mathcal{n}}}$ 
The formula is similar to the [z-statistic](z-statsitic). When shown as a graph it looks much like the [normal distribution](Normal_Distribution) because it is an approximation of it. 
When looking at the table of degrees of freedom for the t-statistic note that after 25 degrees of freedom the table becomes almost the same as the z-statistic
