# Measures of central tendency
There are three tools to use to find the central tendency
- [[Mean]]
- [[Median]]
- [[Mode]]

When finding the central tendency use more then one method or all three if possible to get a better conclusion.
No singular method is better then the other, and each method gives it's own insight into the central tendency.
